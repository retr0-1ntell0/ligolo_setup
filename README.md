## Ligolo setup commands
I love ligolo and love using it. This small bash script helps me with running the initial setup for adding a new tuntap device on my OS.
It is easy to use and had to share it for me not to lose it again because I am lazy running these commands everytime I want to use ligolo.
It is straight forward and really easy to use. Pluss once you are done, you can delete the interface and the route if you want. While quitting `ligolo-proxy` you are not quitting the script. So you can always come back to it in case you want to add more routes, delete routes, add more interfaces, delete interfaces, look at the `ifconfig` of the interfaces, start the proxy, quit the proxy, verify the `ligolo` interface, and quit the script.


The script will ask you to choose an option and then it will do the job for you. But if you are having issues. You can contact me on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/1ntell0) or [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/1098316374125854721) and I will be there to help. If you want to improve this script, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

Hope it helps someone who is also tired of those commands or too much in a rush of typing those commands. 
Planning on adding functionalities as I go because `ligolo-ng` is such a powerfull tool and makes a lot of things easier regarding pivoting.

Keep hacking and enjoy ðŸ˜„
